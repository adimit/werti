	      If I were a train, I'd be late.
    And if I were a good man,
    I'd talk with you
    more often than I do.
    If I were to sleep, I could dream.
    If I were afraid, I could hide.
    If I go insane, please don't put
    your wires in my brain.
    If I were the moon, I'd be cool.
    If I were a rule, I would bend.
    If I were a good man, I'd understand
    the spaces between friends.
    If I were alone, I would cry.
    And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry.
    And if I go insane,
    Will you still let me join in the game?
    If I were a swan, I'd be gone.
    If I were a train, I'd be late again.
    If I were a good man,
    I'd talk with you
    more often than I do.</p>
  <p>So long as Obama wins the elections, I don't care who will get the most votes.</p>
